# Personal Portfolio Site
Creating an online portfolio to advertise my skills as a web developer to potential freelance clients
and potential employers.

## Roadmap
I'm looking to have a completed site with at least 4 portfolio projects by the end of 2020. The site sections 
will include an Introduction, a list of Technologies I use, A short About Me section, Call to Action, and Contact 
details. I'll use HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), a good amount of Javascript (with jQuery) to produce some slick site 
animation, and some server-side JS with node.Js. How and which technologies I use may change as I learn more.
