# Online English Teacher Website
Like the good son that I am, I'm creating a website for my mother. Morag Turpin teaches English to 
speakers of other non-fluent English language students online through video lessons, online resources 
and other such materials.

## Roadmap
Looking to complete this project within the next few months. The site sections will include a Description, 
a list of Resources, Credentials, Testimonials, possible Pricing plans, Call to Action, and contact details.
I'll use HTML, CSS, some Javascript and some server-side with node.Js. How and which technologies I use may 
change as I learn more.

## Authors/acknowledgements
Morag Turpin is responsible for any final copy. Likewise with any teaching resource files.
