# Online English Teacher Website
Like the good son that I am, I'm creating a website for my mother. Morag Turpin teaches English to 
non-fluent English language students online through video lessons, online resources and other such 
materials.

## Roadmap
I'm looking to complete this project by November 2020. The site sections will include a Description, 
a list of Resources, Credentials, Testimonials, possible Pricing plans, Call to Action, and Contact details.
I'll use HTML, CSS, some Javascript and some server-side with node.Js. How and which technologies I use may 
change as I learn more.

## Authors/acknowledgements
Morag Turpin is responsible for any final copy. Likewise with any teaching resource files.
